this is a simple and easy to use to_do list where users can add, mark tasks as comleted and delete tasks 
the to_do list also uses the localatorage to save state so when a to-do list is created or edited its current state will be saved for future reference
the ui of the to_Do list was inspired by the learnables websites color scheme
